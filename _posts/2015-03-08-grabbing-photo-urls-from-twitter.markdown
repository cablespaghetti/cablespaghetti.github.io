Yesterday I helped out at [#CodeOff2015](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23codeoff2015), an event that my employer [Snowflake Software](http://snowflakesoftware.com) runs every year at the [Electronics and Computer Science department at the University of Southampton](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) (which also happens to be where I studied). We give students the day to write software to solve a problem that we set, they get judged at the end of the day and then the winner gets a paid summer internship with our development team. A great way to find talented developers, I'm sure you'll agree!

The morning was a bit hectic, helping everyone to get started and solving a few connectivity problems with the resources we had provided. However after they were all busy coding I thought I'd set myself a little (or so I thought) challenge, to brush up on my (very ropey) Python skills. 

I had set up an internal website within ECS to host the various resources using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and as the day went on, there were lots of photos posted under the hashtag on Twitter. I thought I'd use Twitter's API and Bootstrap's carousel/slideshow feature to show the latest photos on the website.

Initially I used [Twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython) to get the tweets from the API and print out any 'media_url' attributes it found. However whatever I did to tweak the parameters for the Twitter search, I still only got 4 or 5 unique images, which is a fraction of what was posted.
{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from twython import Twython, TwythonError
APP_KEY = ''
APP_SECRET = ''
OAUTH_TOKEN = ''
OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET = ''

# Requires Authentication as of Twitter API v1.1
twitter = Twython(APP_KEY, APP_SECRET, OAUTH_TOKEN, OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET)
try:
    search_results = twitter.search(q='CodeOff2015', count=100, result_type="recent")
except TwythonError as e:
    print(e)

for tweet in search_results['statuses']:
#    print (tweet['text'])
    if 'media' in tweet['entities'].keys():
         media = tweet['entities']['media']
         for mediaitem in media:
             if 'media_url' in mediaitem.keys():
                 print(mediaitem['media_url'])

{% endhighlight %}

I did some thinking and took a different (significantly more hacky) approach. The ['Photos' view](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23codeoff2015&src=typd&mode=photos) on the Twitter website shows many more photos that what I was getting through the API, so I looked into grabbing the HTML and processing it. This uses [urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3) to get the HTML and [Beautiful Soup 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to process it. For our hashtag it seems to get the most recent 12 photos which is much better than the API.
{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

#Grab the html
import urllib3
http = urllib3.PoolManager()
twitterreq = http.request('GET', 'https://twitter.com/search?v=stream&q=%23CodeOff2015&src=typd&mode=photos')
twitterpage = twitterreq.data

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
#Create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML source code
twittersoup = BeautifulSoup(twitterpage)

#Make a list of the link elements which have photos associated with them
linklist = twittersoup.find_all("a", class_="media media-thumbnail twitter-timeline-link media-forward is-preview ")

#Iterate over the list of links
for link in linklist:
    imageurl = link.get('data-resolved-url-large')
    print(imageurl)
{% endhighlight %}
