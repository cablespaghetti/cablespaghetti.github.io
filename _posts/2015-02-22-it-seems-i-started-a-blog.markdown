I've had websites of my own in the past and they always start off great but then get left and eventually taken offline out of embarrassment. I suppose this is due to lack of time, inspiration, or just plain laziness. However since I started a new job as Systems Administrator at [Snowflake Software][snowflake] back in April, there have been quite a few occasions where I've not been able to find a solution to a problem with my standard Internet search (shocking I know!). <!--more-->

Sometimes I can find the solution to these problems by posting on [Server Fault][serverfault] or maybe [/r/sysadmin] but a lot of the time I have to spend a lot of time investigating the problem, write a script or just have a good old thinking session. Solving these tricky problems is probably the most satisfying part of my job (I often have a little silent party at my desk when this happens); so if I can share this satisfaction with the world and save others some time and frustration in the process, then that's ideal!
